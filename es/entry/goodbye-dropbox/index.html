        <p><em>Note: post might be full of referral links whenever I remember to link
to the servicies. Grow up, don't hate. You're smart to by-pass the
referral link and only use the domain part.</em></p>
<p>I have this (ongoing) project that consists in <strong>simplifying my digital
life</strong> (and real life, but we won't get there). This means: Don't use
(many) servicies or programs/apps/how-are-they-called-now? that do the
same thing. Try one that fits all but with my standards in mind;
Uninstall/close useless servicies/programs, etc. You get the idea.</p>
<p>I haven't started yet, but the other day came into mind that I had
"many" file syncing servicies (and must be included in the list). This
is good for the free online/cloud/poof! space. However, believe it or
not, I don't use all of it. Maybe because I use it mainly for
syncing/sharing quick files and not for hosting/sharing for a long time.</p>
<p>Let me sum up the servicies I use/have an account with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>SugarSync</li>
<li>Google Drive (it's like Google+, you have the Google Account and you
click a link, can't beat that <span class="del">lazyness</span> easy sign up procedure)</li>
<li>Box</li>
<li>and let's not forget: Mediafire</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" class="float-left" src="images/2012/logo_mediafire.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com" title="MediaFire">MediaFire</a> is not a file syncing but <strong>storage</strong>. I use it for
sharing large files, for a long time or just host stuff (<a href="%7Cfilename%7C../problemas/autohotkey-nuevacarpeta.md">scripts</a>,
<a href="%7Cfilename%7C../downloads/foobar2000-theme-simple-colorful.md">themes</a>, <a href="http://www.quinzi.com.ar">programs</a>, etc). I don't remember how much space you got
before but now you have <strong>50GB for free</strong> (new or old accounts, hell
yeah). It also has a program to upload/share easily from your desktop.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="float-right" src="images/2012/logo_dropbox.jpg"></p>
<p>Then you have the "king" of file syncing, <a href="http://db.tt/0md5b8D" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a>. As I understand
it, this one was the first to gain popularity, maybe because of
Lifehacker. It creates a folder inside your Documents folders (you can
change it afterwards) and you <strong>only sync that folder</strong>. You get the
client for PCs, Android, etc. and it does sync fast (as soon as you save
the document). The problem (at least for me) is that uses too much CPU
in my Windows machine. When you create an account <strong>you get 2GB</strong>, with
referrals you get 500MB (wow, they've increased it), 300MB of uploading
cap with the web page.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="float-left" src="images/2012/logo_sugarsync.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/referral?rf=eh49qay3q4m0z&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=referral&amp;shareEvent=3722394" title="SugarSync">SugarSync</a> is a <strong>favorite of mine</strong>. It does sync to one folder, as
Dropbox, but also syncs <strong>OTHER folders/files OUTSIDE that folder</strong>.
That feature is not very common (haven't seen another one). It has
desktop clients and Android (etc). The Android version is a bit slow and
is a <a href="%7Cfilename%7C../problemas/android-battery-drain-en.md">battery sucker</a> for me. I'm trying the new beta, probably it was
fixed. <strong>You get 5GB</strong> when you create an account, 500MB per referral,
with no caps.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="float-right" src="images/2012/logo_googledrive.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> is the ~~file~~ <strong>document syncing</strong> service from
Google. Haven't fully tested it because it didn't allow me to edit a
document while offline. (Really Google?). I don't know if it was changed
or not. I don't use many documents (word processors, spreadsheets,
slides...) so "I don't see the point of it"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../../.././es/entry/goodbye-dropbox/#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. You get (according to the
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" title="Wikipedia">All mighty source of knowledge</a> ) <strong>5GB</strong> and 10GB uploading cap per
file (=limitless).</p>
<p><img alt="" class="float-left" src="images/2012/logo_box.png"></p>
<p>Then you have <a href="http://www.box.com" title="Box">Box</a>. To tell you the truth, I only
created an account there because of the free 50GB offer for syncing.
That's it. Haven't tested it yet, I only wanted the space to sync my
podcasts. <strong>You get 5GB</strong> when you create an account (unless you're
lucky like me and can still get the 50GB offer) with a 250MB uploading
cap... via web? it has a client, but I couldn't find if the cap was
applied to it.</p>
<p><br class="clear"><br class="clear"></p>
<p>So, Why make a big deal if you have 122GB for file storage/sync? <em>Man,
are you crazy?</em>. Because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hey! I have more space that those 122GB.</li>
<li><a href="http://db.tt/0md5b8D" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> has <strong>the least space storage</strong></li>
<li>I can close it and I wouldn't miss it</li>
<li>Only syncs one folder</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/referral?rf=eh49qay3q4m0z&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=referral&amp;shareEvent=3722394" title="SugarSync">SugarSync</a> does what <a href="http://db.tt/0md5b8D" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> do plus more</li>
<li>Dropbox's client is painfully <strong>CPU hungry</strong> (on PC)</li>
<li>other reasons... but I like the sketchy images.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only thing I'm going to miss from <a href="http://db.tt/0md5b8D" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> is its <strong>popularity</strong>.
My notes app (Android, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kooklab.epistle">Epistle</a> ) DOES sync with it. It's very nice
and everything (even has markdown support) but it can be easily
replaced: just use wiki software and sync that SD folder with
<a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/referral?rf=eh49qay3q4m0z&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=referral&amp;shareEvent=3722394" title="SugarSync">SugarSync</a> (or wait until the next CintaNotes and hope the free
version syncs with SimpleNotes). It might not be as fast as syncing with
the little (light?)blue box, but I don't care. I don't use the notes app
that much (maaan, I... I... I just like <strong>writing on paper</strong>).</p>
<p>So yeah, I might trash it, change it, melt - upgrade it!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtdWHFwmd2o">technologic</a>... Sorry, I had to do that... I'm going to test (some
day, maybe today... end of the year you know) to <strong>live without
<a href="http://db.tt/0md5b8D" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a></strong> (wouldn't be hard) and replace it with <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/referral?rf=eh49qay3q4m0z&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=referral&amp;shareEvent=3722394" title="SugarSync">SugarSync</a>.</p>
<p>One program less, 10MB gained in my cellphone, cut one account off to
maintain and sync. I bet it would feel great. Who wants to join the
"digital life diet"? <strong>I have cookies</strong> (or <a href="%7Cfilename%7Ccheckerboard-cake.md">cake</a>-it's real ) :D</p>
<div class="footnote">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>It does allow you to sync text files and images. I have heavy use for
them (not thaaaaaaaaaaaat heavy but comparing to the other ones, I do)
but I still see no point in using Google Drive just for that when I can
have other service to do so. Unless Google Drive now has image editing. <a class="footnote-backref" href="../../.././es/entry/goodbye-dropbox/#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
