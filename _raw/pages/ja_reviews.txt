[TOC]


I recommend, if you haven't done it before, find your learning style. Taking the [vark-learn](http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire) questionnaire can be a guide.


Programs, addons, plug-ins
-----------------------------

### SRS 

Don't "kill yourself" with it. It's to review and not study (although some people do it). Just use it for a couple of minutes.

For beginners it's very helpful for the lack of texts in that level, poor grammar and vocabulary. As you advance, decrease the usage and do more reading/listening.

Kana, Kanji  
-------------

### Kana 

**Any book to learn kana is not worth it** 

  * There aren't many: 48 hiragana and 48 "official" katakana.
  * Vocabulary tought can be learnt in another textbook.
  * It's better to learn them by rewriting/memorizing them with SRS/Flashcards (or both). 
  * Few + highly used = you learn them quickly.
  * If you use a textbook, you can learn them with it.
  

### Kanji

  * You can use it to **not fear the kanji** and don't panic when you see one with many strokes.
  * Kanji are presented as building upon previous already learnt kanji
  * Doesn't teach readings (RTK 2). RTK 3 has some kanji that, if you get the new version (6th), shouldn't be so necessary, because includes some obscure kanji.
  * No so recommended if you don't care the how-to-write part (You can learn the basic rules and write most of the kanji with that).
  * Not all the characters have stories, about half-way onwards you have to create them yourself.

It's recommended (if you have old versions from the 6th): [delete unnecessary kanji](http://japaneselevelup.com/2011/08/03/filtering-out-remembering-the-kanji-flaws-1-500/) of the first and third version or [download the anki deck](http://japaneselevelup.com/2011/09/04/japanese-level-up-rtk-mod-anki-deck/).
