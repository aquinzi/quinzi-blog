wanted to know if that game exists for other languages that don't use
latin alphabet. As I'm learning Japanese I'll focus on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, Japanese Scrabble (with kana) doesn't exist.
However, there are some variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first that I found is called ロメオ that uses romaji. Therefore, it's a
simple adaptation from Scrabble but with "the most used romaji letters".
If someone wants it, it costs about 2500円.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sgrk.blog53.fc2.com/?no=1586"&gt;Via this site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other ones I found are called: エンブレインIQプラス あいうえおプラス (with its 2
version), with its "kids" version (box with cute drawings) as well as
its "grown up" version (simplier box)... which is the difference? I have
no idea beside the boxes. If someone wants to buy it, it cost 1500円.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="del"&gt;How the hell do you play that and what about the point system? No
idea. It doesn't have a tableu nor the chips have numbers. It must be&lt;/span&gt;
is a learning game &lt;span class="del"&gt;I suppose.... well yeah, obviously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of minutes falling to read japanese posts, I realized I
could read the game's box. According to this little cute box, and for
what I understand, it's something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mix the chips and put them on a surface face down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take one you don't need out and put it where the rest of the chips
are (the ones faced down) but putting it face up, and take another
one...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rinse and repeat the last step until you have a word/s with those 6
chips? I guess it's allowed to make words with less chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to play japanese Scrabble! I know, me too... but it doens't
exist per se... the above game only has the 46 kana, no more, no
repetition. What you can do is to perform a frequency analysis, create
chips according to that, take Scrabble tableu and there you have it! :D
Hard and long way, but you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S I guess the Chinese version doesn't exist, right? :P&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>scrabble</category><guid>http://getnikola.com/misc/scrabble-japones/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2012 17:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
